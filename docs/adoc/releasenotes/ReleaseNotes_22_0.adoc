== New 3rd Party requirements

=== Java

The Java 8 support has been dropped in Scout 22.
Therefore, only Java 11 is supported at the moment.
Support for Java 17 is planned for a future release.

Furthermore, the minimal Maven version has been raised to 3.6.3.

See the migration guide for instructions on how to update.

Please note that Scout 22 makes use of `Jakarta EE 8` artifacts.
These artifacts already use the new `jakarta.\*` Maven coordinates but still contain the old `javax.*` Java packages.
This ensures backwards compatibility with older `Java EE 8` containers.
The transition to `Jakarta EE 9.1` or newer is planned for a future release.

=== Browsers

The minimal supported browsers have been updated. Scout 22 has the following requirements:

* Mozilla Firefox >= 55
* Chromium (like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave or Opera) >= 58
* Apple Safari >= 12.1

Please note that Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge Legacy are no longer supported by Scout.
If you are still using Internet Explorer or Edge Legacy, we strongly recommend updating to a newer browser.

== Native Notification Support

It's now possible to send notifications via the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API[Notification API].
The `DesktopNotification` has two new properties to control the behavior: *nativeOnly* and *nativeNotificationVisibility*.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Text Post-Processors

A new bean *org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.nls.ITextPostProcessor* has been introduced which allows to modify all texts returned by a TextProviderService.

This allows applying application wide logic on all translated texts including the ones provided by Scout itself.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Log4j support removed

The Support for https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[Log4j] logging has been dropped as Log4j 1 is end-of-life.
If you still rely on Log4j 1 please consult the migration notes for instructions how to update.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Browser Field: Support for Posting Messages

Browser fields provide a new method *postMessage(data, targetOrigin)* to send arbitrary data to the embedded web page.

To prevent malicious data from being sent to your application, the origin of the message should always be validated in the callback handler
(`execPostMessage` in Java, `message` event listener in Scout JS).
Scout will now do this check automatically for you if you configure the valid origins in the new property *trustedMessageOrigins*.

== Icon Support for Notifications

Notifications in GroupBoxes (`IGroupBox.setNotification()`) and desktop notifications (`IDesktop.addNotification`) now also support icons.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== REST LookupCall support for hierarchical data

Scout lookup calls may return hierarchically linked rows (parent-child relation).
The support for hierarchical lookup rows using REST lookup calls (e.g. the `parentId` attribute definition) was moved from `AbstractLookupRowDo` to the new class `AbstractHierarchicalLookupRowDo`.

In order to support hierarchical lookups using REST, change your lookup row implementation and extend the new base class `AbstractHierachicalLookupRowDo`.

[source,java]
.Example
----
@TypeName("ExampleLookupRow")
public class ExampleLookupRowDo extends AbstractHierarchicalLookupRowDo<MyLookupRowDo, ExampleId> {

  @Override
  public DoValue<ExampleId> id() {
    return createIdAttribute(this);
  }

  @Override
  public DoValue<ExampleId> parentId() {
    return createParentIdAttribute(this);
  }

  // ...
}
----

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== REST API Documentation Generation: Support for inheritance

The annotation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.doc.ApiDocDescription` is now marked as `@Inherited`.
This allows inheritance for API documentation (e.g. on an abstract REST resource).

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== New Filter Field

The widgets `Table.js`, `Tree.js`, `TileGrid.js` and `TileAccordion.js` support a text filter since 22.0.
This filter field is shown while typing if the widget is focused or can be opened by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner.

.A TreeBox with the filter icon in the bottom right corner.

.A TreeBox with the filter field, filtering all nodes for 'latin'.

This feature is enabled by default and can be turned off using the property `textFilterEnabled`.
